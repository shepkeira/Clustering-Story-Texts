Four girls were walking home from a Halloween party in 2002. They were walking by an old abandoned factory that stood next to a field. The factory was said to be haunted and many people in the area refused to set fott inside the factory grounds. When they got to the middle of the field, one of the girls said it would be fun to explore the old factory. The other girls were scared at first, but eventually one of them agreed to do it just for fun so they could tell their friends at school about it. Two of the girls climbed over the fence and the other two girls waited outside for them. After about twenty minutes had passed, the two remaining girls started getting worried. Suddenly, they heard blood-curdling screams coming from inside the old factory. It sounded like their friends. Terrified, the two girls ran all the way home. The two girls who went into the factory were never seen again. Today, the factory still stands they say that if you dare to enter the grounds on Halloween night, then you too will vanish, never to be seen again.
