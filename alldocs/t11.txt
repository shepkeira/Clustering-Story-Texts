On Halloween night in 2008, there was a mass murder. The police were called and two homicide detectives went to investigate the horrible crime. Trying not to tread on the bodies, the police took pictures of each one. One policemen saw something on the opposite wall but he couldn't read it. He walks over to it and sees what looked like the numbers "7734", written in blood. When taking pictures of this he turned his digital camera upside-down and showed it to his partner. When he pointed with the hand that the camera was in, he accidentally took a picture of the upside-down numbers. The policeman was about to delete the picture when he realized something. The numbers were now a word. The word was "hELL."
