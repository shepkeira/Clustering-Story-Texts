According to legend, every Halloween, a strange and grotesque old lady roams the streets, preying on children who are trick-or-treating alone. Some call her "The Leg Woman" and others refer to her as "The Legmonger".
One boy was on his own when he heard a rustling in the bushes next to him. An old woman with stringy, black hair and a hideous, wrinkled face emerged from the undergrowth. The boy was startled to see she was holding a severed leg in her hands and waving it in his face.
"Do you want a leg?", she cried. "Do you want a LEEEEG?"
The boy assumed it was just a halloween prop, but the woman was so disturbing that he began backing away from her. She persisted, asking him over and over if he wanted a leg.
Finally, the boy said "No! I don't want a leg!"
A group of adults and children who were nearby, heard a horrible scream ringing out in the darkened street. They rushed around the corner and got the shock of their lives when they discovered a young boy lying on the ground in a pool of blood. His right leg had been completely ripped off at the hip.
If you meet the Leg Woman on Halloween night, be careful. She will come up to you and ask "Do you want a leg?"
If you answer "No", she will tear off your leg and disappear. If you answer "Yes", she will grab you and try to attach the severed leg she is carrying to your body. 
The correct answer is "I want both my legs!
